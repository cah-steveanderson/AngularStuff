Spotify App
===========

You'll be designing a web application for music using the Spotify API [documentation here](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/endpoint-reference/). This is a fairly open ended project, so have some fun with it! You'll be using Javascript, Angular JS, Spotify's RESTFUL API, and of course - HTML.

Expected Learning opportunities:
 * Working with public APIs (Spotify)
 * Making RESTFUL API calls
 * Understanding MVC
 * Designing a web app using Angular JS
 * Understand Fuse's implementation of Agile


Desired functionality:

* Ability to search for artists, albums, songs
* Display results of artists, albums, songs (be creative with this)
* Be able to display the available artwork/images with those results (consider using frameworks like masonry or isotope)
* Ability to sort the results (maybe by popularity, name, relevance, etc.)
* Create and maintain playlists of songs and store them in a datastore

Setup steps:

1. Create a [github account](https://github.com/) (if you don't already have one)
